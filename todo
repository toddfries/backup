- backup the local system
  - dump://hostname/dir
    - hostname is only for the dir creation
    - fix the level>0 time issue
- backup samba shares accessable only via smbclient on a remote system
  - sshsmb://user@hostname/authname@remotesambahost/remotesharename
  - timestamp/auth info is xfered by execing a shell remotely, fix this!
- concurrency
 - 1st implement rough `maxconcurrence' per backup set
  - look at fetchitdave for inspiration
 - 2nd implement `maxconcurrence' per host and per backup set
 - setup level 0 backups in one queue, non lebel 0 in another, to
   permit new hosts etc to not keep level>0 backups from happening for days
- move filelist creation earlier, so .host_filesyst.level.filelist is moved
   with the rest instead of created after the move
 - perhaps even create the filelist via 'tee' and a fifo or somesuch
   so that reading the data happens as is it written to the disk, not
   reading it back causing more disk io

- error cleanup, don't leave unfinished backups lying around
- verify collections don't have more than one backup process running,
   so backups that take more than 24hrs will block other backups from
   running
  - almost makes some sense to have levels somewhat automatic, so one
    does not end up skipping level 1's for example because the night before's
    backup took too long

- show the time the backup is relative to, if not level 0
- permit using '-h' flag of dump
- permit archiving to tape, e.g. ipmr
